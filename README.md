# Module 21 – KNN Case Study on Diabetes
---
## Objective
---
In this module, you will apply the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to build a Diabetes Prediction Model. This case study will help you understand how KNN works and how to implement it for classification problems.
---
## Reference
---
Watch the Module 21 video carefully. The concepts and steps explained there will guide you in completing this case study.
---
## Dataset
---
You can use the Diabetes dataset available on Kaggle
---
## Task Instructions
---
- Import and explore the dataset (check for missing values, data types, etc.).
- Perform data preprocessing (handle missing data, normalize features if necessary).
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for prediction.
- Evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other suitable metrics.
- Provide a short analysis of your results.
